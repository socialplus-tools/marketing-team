# social.plus internal linking strategy

This file is the single source of truth for **canonical anchor → page** decisions, **cannibalization warnings**, and **anchor variation rules** across the social.plus content ecosystem. The `internal-linking-optimizer` skill consumes this file at runtime.

**Generated:** 2026-04-17
**Refresh by:** 2026-07-17 (90 days)
**Data sources:**
- Ahrefs site-explorer (organic-keywords, top-pages, pages-by-internal-links, domain-rating) for `social.plus` (subdomains, both protocols)
- Ahrefs GSC integration (gsc-keywords, gsc-pages) for project `7031381` — last 90 days of real Google Search Console data
- The 10 `pages-*.json` snapshots in this directory (regenerated automatically on every Webflow publish)

**Site benchmarks at generation time:**
- Domain Rating (Ahrefs): **65**
- Top organic page (non-brand): `https://www.social.plus/white-label/social-network` (606 monthly traffic, UR 7.0)
- Highest-UR page: `https://www.social.plus/` (UR 11.0) — primary authority hub
- Total ranked keywords surveyed: top 200 by traffic, top 300 by GSC clicks

## Data scope

The optimizer reads from these files (all in `website/` of this repo). Together they index **646 pages**:

| File | Items | Role for linking |
|---|---|---|
| `pages-marketing.json` | 22 | Primary commercial targets — homepage, product/feature/SDK pages, white-label pages |
| `pages-use-cases.json` | 11 | Use-case framings (`/use-case/*`) |
| `pages-industry.json` | 10 | Industry vertical pages (`/industry/*`) |
| `pages-glossary.json` | 76 | Definitional/informational targets (`/glossary/*`) |
| `pages-blog.json` | 248 | Blog → blog cross-linking; long-tail informational |
| `pages-customer-stories.json` | 42 | Proof-point links (`/customer-story/*`) |
| `pages-answers.json` | 123 | AEO related-answer links (`/answers/*`) |
| `pages-product-updates.json` | 58 | "What's new" reference links |
| `pages-release-notes.json` | 31 | Specific release reference links |
| `pages-webinars.json` | 25 | Webinar reference links |

All entries share the same shape: `{url, metaTitle, metaDescription, content}`. URLs are full `https://www.social.plus/...`.

**Which files to fetch by context** (the optimizer applies these defaults):
- **Blog draft (called by `blog-seo-content`):** marketing + use-cases + industry + glossary + blog + customer-stories
- **AEO draft (called by `aeo-content`):** marketing + use-cases + glossary + answers (related-answers)
- **Standalone audit:** all 10 files
- **Standalone draft (user-pasted content):** marketing + use-cases + industry + glossary by default; ask if more is needed

## How to use this file

**Draft mode (when called by `blog-seo-content`, `aeo-content`, etc.):**

1. Identify candidate anchor terms in the draft.
2. For each candidate, check the **canonical anchor map** below — if the anchor matches a row, use the listed target URL.
3. Cross-check against **cannibalization warnings** — if a warning fires, follow its rule (use the recommended target, or split intent: definitional → glossary, commercial → product page).
4. Apply **per-cluster anchor variation rules** — no anchor should appear more than twice per article pointing to the same page.
5. Prefer **link-equity hubs** as targets when contextually appropriate (homepage, white-label pages, top-traffic glossary entries).

**Audit mode (standalone):**

1. Compare site-wide anchor usage against the canonical anchor map. Flag mismatches.
2. Cross-reference cannibalization warnings against current link patterns. Flag violations.
3. Identify orphans by looking for pages with no contextual inbound links across all 10 files.
4. Recommend phased fixes.

### Glossary (definitional anchors)

The glossary indexes 76 definitional pages. **Default rule:** use a glossary anchor only when the surrounding context is *defining* the term, not pitching the product. For commercial intent, use the product/use-case page above. Common pairs where intent matters:

| Definitional anchor → glossary | Commercial alternative → product/use-case |
|---|---|
| "social feed" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/social-feed` | "activity feed" → `https://www.social.plus/use-case/activity-feed` |
| "activity feed" (defining) → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/activity-feed` | "activity feed" (product) → `https://www.social.plus/use-case/activity-feed` |
| "video SDK" (defining) → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/video-sdk` | "video SDK" (commercial) → `https://www.social.plus/video/sdk` |
| "websocket" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/websocket` | (no commercial alternative) |
| "user retention", "user engagement", "session length", "interaction rate" | (definitional only) → matching `/glossary/*` |
| "white label chat" (defining) → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/white-label-chat` | "white label chat" (commercial) → `https://www.social.plus/white-label/chat-software` |
| "white label social features" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/white-label-social-features` | (commercial → `/white-label/social-network` or `/social`) |
| "white label social network" (defining) → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/white-label-social-network` | "white label social network" (commercial) → `https://www.social.plus/white-label/social-network` |
| "vertical social network" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/vertical-social-network` | (definitional only — be careful, "social network" is a forbidden positioning term per terminology.md) |
| "chat widget" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/chat-widget` | (commercial → `/chat`) |
| "chat channel" → `https://www.social.plus/glossary/chat-channel` | (commercial → `/chat`) |

For glossary terms not in this table, use them as link targets only in genuinely definitional/explanatory passages (e.g., AEO articles, blog post lead-in sections defining a concept).

## Cannibalization warnings

Pairs or groups of pages competing for the same query. Follow the recommendation strictly.

### ⚠️ "social plus AI" / "social+ AI" — 42 URLs ranking
**Top URL (GSC):** `https://www.social.plus/analytics` (115 clicks/90d for "social plus ai")
**Risk:** 42 different URLs rank for variants of this brand+AI query. Without consolidation, link equity is split.
**Rule:** When an article mentions "social.plus AI", anchor it to `https://www.social.plus/analytics`. Do not create new alternative landing pages for "AI" without first consolidating.

### ⚠️ "live video" vs `/use-case/livestream`
**Top URL:** `https://www.social.plus/video` (top URL for both "live video" and "online live video" per GSC and Ahrefs)
**Rule:** Anchor "live video" / "online live video" → `https://www.social.plus/video`. Anchor "livestream" / "in-app livestream" → `https://www.social.plus/use-case/livestream`. Never anchor "live video" to `https://www.social.plus/use-case/livestream`.

### ⚠️ "chat API" — informational vs commercial split
**Pages:** `https://www.social.plus/glossary/chat-api` (informational) vs `https://www.social.plus/chat`, `https://www.social.plus/chat/sdk` (commercial)
**Rule:**
- **Informational/definitional** content (e.g., "what is a chat API", AEO articles): anchor "chat API" → glossary.
- **Commercial/product** content (blog posts pitching social.plus): anchor "chat API" → `/chat/sdk` (developer-intent) or `/chat` (decision-maker intent).
- **Never use the same anchor "chat API" pointing to two different pages within a single article.**

### ⚠️ "video SDK" — informational vs commercial split
**Pages:** `https://www.social.plus/glossary/video-sdk` vs `https://www.social.plus/video/sdk`
**Rule:** Same pattern as chat API. Definitional → glossary; commercial → product page.

### ⚠️ "social feed" vs "activity feed" — definitional vs product split
**Pages:** `https://www.social.plus/glossary/social-feed` vs `https://www.social.plus/use-case/activity-feed` vs `https://www.social.plus/glossary/activity-feed`
**Rule:**
- "social feed" (definitional) → glossary
- "activity feed" (product, in pitch context) → use-case page
- "activity feed" (defining the term) → glossary
- Never use "social feed" anchor in product framing — readers expect the glossary.

### ⚠️ "white label social network" / "white label chat" — definitional vs commercial split
The data layer now has BOTH a glossary entry and a commercial page for these terms.
**Rule:**
- Defining the term (e.g., AEO article, blog explainer): anchor → `/glossary/white-label-social-network` or `/glossary/white-label-chat`.
- Pitching the product (commercial blog, comparison content): anchor → `/white-label/social-network` or `/white-label/chat-software`.
- These are HIGH-VALUE commercial keywords (Ahrefs: top 3 ranks across multiple "white label" terms). Don't dilute by mixing the two.

### ⚠️ "engagement rate" — weak SERP, not a linking issue
**Page:** `https://www.social.plus/glossary/engagement-rate` (12,393 impressions, 0.19% CTR over 90d per GSC)
**Note:** Page exists and ranks but underperforms in SERP. **No linking action required.** Flag for the content team as a separate page-health issue (title/meta refresh).

### ⚠️ Brand URL splitting — informational only
54+ URLs rank for "socialplus" / "social plus" / "social+". For brand terms, Google routes correctly to `/`. **No action required**, but be aware: when writing about social.plus on third-party sites or guest posts, always link the brand mention to `https://www.social.plus/`, never to a feature page.

### ⚠️ "social network" terminology is forbidden in positioning
Per `messaging/terminology.md`, do not call social.plus a "social network" or "forum platform". The `/glossary/vertical-social-network` page exists for definitional/informational content but never anchor it from copy that's pitching social.plus — this is a brand positioning rule, not just a linking rule.

## Link-equity hubs (concentration of authority)

When suggesting link **destinations** in draft mode, these are high-priority targets — linking *to* them reinforces site-wide authority. When suggesting link **sources** in audit mode, these pages are also where outbound links matter most.

| Page | URL Rating | File |
|---|---|---|
| `https://www.social.plus/` | 11.0 | pages-marketing |
| `https://www.social.plus/white-label/social-network` | 7.0 | pages-marketing |
| `https://www.social.plus/glossary/social-feed` | 4.6 | pages-glossary |
| `https://www.social.plus/glossary/community-app` | 4.5 | pages-glossary |
| `https://www.social.plus/glossary/video-sdk` | 4.5 | pages-glossary |
| `https://www.social.plus/glossary/engagement-rate` | 4.4 | pages-glossary |
| `https://www.social.plus/glossary/chat-api` | 4.4 | pages-glossary |
| `https://www.social.plus/blog/what-is-community-based-marketing-cbm` | 4.4 | pages-blog |

Notable absence: no in-scope product/feature page broke UR 4.0 at generation time. **This is a finding, not a bug** — product pages are commercial/short-tail and don't accumulate organic backlinks the way glossary/blog content does. Audit mode should propose internal linking patterns that direct authority *from* the high-UR glossary/blog pages *to* product pages.

---

## Orphan / under-linked pages

From Ahrefs `pages-by-internal-links` (ascending). Most "orphan" results were pagination artifacts (`?f806444f_page=2` Webflow query strings) or `docs.social.plus` RSS feeds — those are **not real orphans**.

**Real candidates worth flagging in audit mode:**
- `/events/*` pages (e.g., `/events/understanding-zero-party-data-part-2`) — multiple events appear with only 1 inbound link (events aren't yet in the data files)
- All marketing pages have nav links from header/footer so are not *technical* orphans, but these are *contextually* under-linked per data patterns:
  - `/monetization` — rarely cross-linked
  - `/video/features` — under-linked vs `/video` itself
  - `/industry/edtech`, `/industry/health-and-wellness` — less prominent than `/industry/gaming` or `/industry/betting` in current cross-linking
  - `/use-case/groups`, `/use-case/user-profiles` — fewer inbound contextual links than other use cases

**Note:** The contextual under-linking is a hypothesis from data patterns. Confirm with audit mode runs against the JSON data before acting.

---

## Per-cluster anchor variation rules

To avoid over-optimization, each cluster has 5-8 anchor variants. **Rule:** within a single article, the same anchor pointing to the same page should appear no more than **twice**. Use variants for additional links to the same target.

### Chat cluster
Targets: `/chat`, `/chat/features`, `/chat/sdk`, `/chat/uikit`, `/use-case/live-chat`, `/use-case/group-chat`, `/use-case/1-1-chat`, `/white-label/chat-software`

Anchor variants pool:
- "in-app chat"
- "chat infrastructure"
- "messaging SDK" / "chat SDK"
- "real-time messaging"
- "chat features"
- "build chat into your app"
- "in-app messaging"
- "messaging infrastructure"
- "white label chat"

### Social cluster
Targets: `/social`, `/social/features`, `/social/sdk`, `/social/uikit`, `/social/stories`, `/use-case/activity-feed`, `/use-case/groups`, `/use-case/user-profiles`, `/use-case/custom-posts`, `/use-case/polls`, `/white-label/social-network`, `/white-label/in-app-community`

Anchor variants pool:
- "in-app community"
- "social features"
- "activity feed"
- "social SDK"
- "community building blocks"
- "in-app social experiences"
- "user-generated content infrastructure"
- "white label community"
- "white label social platform"

### Video cluster
Targets: `/video`, `/video/features`, `/video/sdk`, `/use-case/livestream`, `/use-case/stories-and-clips`, `/use-case/events`, `/vs-stream`

Anchor variants pool:
- "live video"
- "in-app livestream"
- "video SDK"
- "live streaming SDK"
- "stories and clips"
- "video infrastructure"
- "events platform"
- "alternative to Stream"

### Industry cluster
Targets: `/industry/retail`, `/industry/fitness`, `/industry/travel`, `/industry/sports`, `/industry/health-and-wellness`, `/industry/fintech`, `/industry/media-and-news`, `/industry/edtech`, `/industry/gaming`, `/industry/betting`

Anchor variants pool (substitute industry name):
- "[industry] community platform"
- "[industry] engagement"
- "social features for [industry]"
- "in-app community for [industry]"
- "[industry] social SDK"

### Cross-cluster
- `/moderation`: "moderation", "content moderation", "community moderation", "in-app moderation"
- `/monetization`: "monetization", "in-app monetization", "social commerce", "community monetization"
- `/analytics`: "analytics", "engagement analytics", "community analytics", "social.plus AI" (with the cannibalization caveat above)
- `/pricing`: "pricing", "social.plus pricing", "see pricing"

## Blog → blog cross-linking

`pages-blog.json` contains 248 articles. The optimizer treats blog posts as both *sources* and *targets* for cross-links. Guidelines:

- **Pillar/hub blog posts** (highest UR or sum_traffic per Ahrefs): `/blog/what-is-community-based-marketing-cbm` (UR 4.4), `/blog/effective-customer-engagement-strategies-with-case-studies` (pos #1 for "customer engagement case studies"). These deserve more inbound cross-links.
- **Avoid same-anchor-twice pattern across the entire blog.** If two different blog posts both anchor "community engagement" to the same target, prefer variation.
- **Don't cross-link to outdated posts.** Check `metaTitle` / `metaDescription` for clearly dated content (year in title, deprecated framing). Optimizer should flag outdated targets.
- **Cluster blog posts around a hub.** If 3+ blog posts cover variants of a topic, identify the strongest one as hub and link the others to it.

---

## AEO related-answers

`pages-answers.json` contains 123 AEO articles. AEO articles are reference content cited by AI engines — over-linking dilutes citation value. Guidelines:

- **Maximum 1-3 internal links per AEO article.** Stricter than blog.
- **Allowed link locations:** definition paragraph, "why it matters", architecture/features sections, step-by-step. **Disallowed:** FAQs, conclusion, metrics table.
- **AEO → AEO related-answer links:** at most 1 per article, placed in the definition paragraph or step-by-step. Use when the linked article extends a concept (e.g., "API for Integrating Complete Social Features into Apps" can link to a more specific "Chat API" answer).
- **AEO → glossary links** are usually a better fit than AEO → product pages for the definitional sections.
- **AEO → product page links** belong in the "social.plus pitch" section.

---

## Customer stories as proof points

`pages-customer-stories.json` contains 42 customer stories. Use as link targets when:

- A blog post or marketing page mentions a customer by name (link the customer name to their story).
- A claim needs proof (e.g., "60% MoM growth" → link to Smart Fit story).
- Industry pages (`/industry/*`) should link to customer stories from that industry where available.

**Caution:** Only cite approved customer names per `messaging/terminology.md`. The data file may contain stories for customers not yet approved for marketing use — when in doubt, skip.

## Refresh procedure

To regenerate this file, re-run these Ahrefs MCP queries (current values noted for diff comparison):

```
management-projects → confirm social.plus project ID is still 7031381
site-explorer-domain-rating(target=social.plus, date=today) → expect DR ~65
site-explorer-organic-keywords(target=social.plus, mode=subdomains, protocol=both, date=today, select="keyword,best_position,best_position_url,volume,sum_traffic,is_branded,is_commercial,is_informational,keyword_difficulty", order_by="sum_traffic:desc", limit=200)
site-explorer-top-pages(target=social.plus, mode=subdomains, protocol=both, date=today, select="url,sum_traffic,value,top_keyword,top_keyword_volume,top_keyword_best_position,keywords,ur", order_by="sum_traffic:desc", limit=60)
site-explorer-pages-by-internal-links(target=social.plus, mode=subdomains, protocol=both, select="url_to,links_to_target,dofollow_to_target,url_rating_target", order_by="links_to_target:asc", limit=100)
gsc-keywords(project_id=7031381, date_from=today-90d, date_to=today, limit=300)
gsc-pages(project_id=7031381, date_from=today-90d, date_to=today, limit=100)
```

After running, review:
1. **New cannibalization candidates:** any keyword in the GSC table where `urls_count > 10` AND it's NOT a brand term.
2. **New top pages:** changes in the top 10 by sum_traffic — update the canonical map and hub list.
3. **New orphans:** pages with `links_to_target` ≤ 2 that should not be (skip pagination/RSS artifacts).
4. **DR drift:** if DR moves more than ±5, re-evaluate the linking strategy at a higher level (Stefan).
5. **New pages in the JSON snapshots:** check `_meta.itemCount` for each `pages-*.json` — a jump in count means new pages need to be added to the canonical map and cannibalization analysis.

Update the `Generated:` and `Refresh by:` dates at the top.
