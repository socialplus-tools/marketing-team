## How updates work

**Reference content** (markdown files in `messaging/`, `design-system/`, `emails/`): Edit on GitHub, changes are live immediately for all team members. No reinstall needed.

**Skill logic** (SKILL.md files in `skills/`): Changes require team members to update the plugin.

**Website snapshots** (`website/pages-*.json`): 10 auto-generated JSON files covering every published page on social.plus — marketing, industry, use cases, blog, glossary, answers, customer stories, release notes, product updates, and webinars. Regenerated by a Cloudflare Worker on every Webflow publish (site publish refreshes marketing + industry; per-collection CMS publish refreshes the rest).
