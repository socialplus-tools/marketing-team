## How it works

Each skill fetches its reference files live from GitHub every time it triggers. All skills also fetch `brain.md` (the main brain) which provides cross-domain routing, precedence rules, and a compliance check. The actual content lives at:

- [`messaging/`](../messaging) — Brand messaging files (tone, terminology, positioning, narrative, boilerplates, UI micro-copy)
- [`design-system/`](../design-system) — Full visual design system (colors, typography, spacing, buttons, shadows, layout, accessibility, and more)
- [`assets/`](../assets) — Official logo SVGs
- [`emails/`](../emails) — Email template reference, strategy guide, and HTML examples
- [`website/`](../website) — Live website content JSON files (10 inventories: marketing, industry, use cases, blog, glossary, answers, customer stories, release notes, product updates, webinars) auto-updated by a Cloudflare Worker on every Webflow publish

## Installation

Install via the marketplace in Claude Cowork, or download the plugin folder and install manually. Works in Cowork and Claude Code (any environment with WebFetch or bash access).

## Updating content

Edit the markdown files in `messaging/` or `design-system/` on GitHub. Changes are live immediately for all team members — no plugin reinstall needed.

Skill logic changes (SKILL.md files) require team members to update the plugin.
