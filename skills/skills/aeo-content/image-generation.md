# AEO Hero Image Generation

This file explains how to generate a Google Gemini image prompt for an AEO answer article's hero image. The full visual style guide, icon reference table, and example prompts are in a separate file.

## Full style guide

The complete prompt template with hex colors, icon reference tables, composition modes, and worked examples is not yet published. It will be added later. For now, this file contains the decision logic for composing prompts — the detailed style guide will be linked here once it is ready.

## How to generate a prompt

### Step 1: Pick the composition mode

**Mode B (floating exploded view)** if the article title:
- Starts with "What is" or "What are"
- Is a broad definition or concept overview

**Mode A (diorama on platform)** for everything else. This is the default — it covers how-to guides, API articles, tool/platform/solution articles, retention, monetization, engagement, feeds, private networks, SDK, white-label.

### Step 2: Classify the topic cluster

Match the article title to one of these clusters based on the primary noun or concept:

| Cluster | Title signals |
|---|---|
| Activity feeds / social feeds | "activity feed", "social feed", "feed" as main subject |
| Community features (general) | "community features", "community capabilities" |
| White-label / SDK / embedding | "white-label", "SDK", "embed" |
| Social networks / full social | "social network", "social features", "social functionality" |
| Retention | "retention", "keep users", "stickiness" |
| Monetization | "monetization", "monetize" |
| Revenue | "revenue", "income" |
| Engagement | "engagement", "engage", "interaction strategies" |
| Private social networks | "private social network", "private community" |
| Decentralized social | "decentralized", "distributed" |
| API / integration | "API", "integrate" (without SDK or white-label) |
| Platform / tool / solution | "platform for", "tool for", "solution for" (catch-all) |
| Planning community features | "plan", "planning", "roadmap" |
| Examples / case studies | "examples of", "case study" |

### Step 3: Select 5-6 objects

Use the Topic-to-Objects Mapping table in `docs/aeo-image-prompt-template.md`. Follow these rules:
- Always include at least one people element (user group, profile card, avatars)
- Always include at least one interaction element (heart, chat bubble, thumbs up)
- Pick 3-4 topic-specific objects from the recommended list
- If generating multiple prompts in one session, vary the objects for similar topics
- Use the exact "Prompt description" phrasing from the Icon Reference Table

### Step 4: Assemble the prompt

Combine into one continuous block of text (no markdown headers or formatting):
1. **Style Prefix** — copy verbatim from the template file
2. **Composition Mode** paragraph — Mode A or B, copy verbatim
3. **Topic line**: `Topic: [Article Title]`
4. **Objects line**: `Feature these 3D objects in the scene:` followed by a comma-separated list of the selected objects

Present the assembled prompt in a single code block, ready to copy-paste.

## Aspect ratio note

The Gemini API supports: 1:1, 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4. The hero images are approximately 3:2, so use **16:9** as the closest option when calling the API.

## Output

After the code block, add a brief summary:
- **Mode**: A (diorama) or B (floating)
- **Cluster**: which topic cluster was matched
- **Objects**: short list of what was included
