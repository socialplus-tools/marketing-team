## Notes

- LLM-sourced questions are candidate fillers when PAA/Reddit returned fewer than 8 strong candidates. Prefer PAA/Reddit when both are available.
- Article 3 question 8 ("Can I buy zero-party data?") is a common misconception; keep it if the colleague wants an explicitly corrective FAQ.

## Approval syntax

Per article, on its own line:
```
article 1: approve 1-4, drop 5, 7
article 2: approve 1, 3, 5; revise 2 — focus on operational load not policy
article 3: approve 1, 2, 4, 6
next
```

Final FAQ uses 4-6 of the approved questions per article. If more than 6 are approved, the draft phase picks the 6 strongest and lists the rest as "deferred" in the overview.
