# AEO Article Generation

_Last updated: 2026-04-20_

AEO articles live at `social.plus/answers/[slug]`. They exist so large-language models will extract and cite them. Every rule in this skill serves that goal.

## Standing instructions

This file is loaded once per session and cached in context. Everything below is a standing rule for the whole task, not a one-time checklist. Treat each numbered step as a gate — if you can't satisfy it, stop and surface the problem rather than proceeding.

## Three load-bearing AEO principles

Every structural and stylistic decision ties back to one of these. If a decision doesn't obviously serve one of them, reconsider.

1. **Answer-first extractability.** First sentence answers the title's question using the exact target-keyword phrase. First two sentences fit in 40-60 words. TL;DR paragraph of 120-160 words sits immediately below. This is the block LLMs extract verbatim. The 120-160 range is the 94th-percentile sweet spot for Google AI Overview passage selection (2025 ranking-factor study); shorter chunks are consistently passed over for longer, more self-contained competitor chunks.
2. **Semantic chunking.** Every major section is a self-contained ~150-word passage. Entities are defined inline on first mention within a chunk, not only in the intro.
3. **Concrete grounding.** Named examples, numeric ranges, and internal consistency with product terminology. Citations where they genuinely support a claim — not as SEO padding.

## Single article vs. batch

Two modes, chosen from the brief:

- **Single article** — the user asks for one specific article ("write an AEO article on activity feeds"). Run the linear flow in "Before writing" below, then "Writing" and "Delivery".
- **Batch** — the user asks for multiple articles, a theme, or ideas ("5 articles on community infrastructure", "some ideas for /answers/", "a batch on moderation"). Run the four-phase workflow described in "Batch workflow" near the end of this file. Full phase specs live in `references/workflow-phases.md`.

When unclear, ask: "Single article now, or a batch of ideas to work through in phases?" Default to batch if the brief mentions a count ≥2 or the word "ideas".

## Before writing

### 1. Intake — minimal, only when the brief is genuinely ambiguous

**Default behavior: do not ask intake questions.** If the brief names a topic ("write an AEO article on in-app activity feeds", "answer page on zero-party data"), proceed straight to the duplicate check. Infer everything else:

- **Intent** — infer from the title phrasing. "What is X?" → definition. "How to X?" / "How do you X?" → procedural. "X vs Y" / "alternatives to X" → comparative. If the phrasing could be multiple, default to definition.
- **Audience** — social.plus's default audience is product and engineering teams at consumer apps. Use that unless told otherwise.
- **Must-cover sub-topics** — pick the sub-topics the intent pattern naturally calls for (see `references/patterns/*.md`). Do not ask.
- **Word count** — use the intent-specific typical range (definition 900-1400, procedural 1100-1800, comparative 1000-1600). Do not ask.

**Only use `AskUserQuestion`** when something is genuinely unresolvable:

- The topic name has multiple plausible meanings (`feeds` — activity feeds? news feeds? RSS?) → ask *one* question: which one?
- The title phrasing doesn't clearly map to an intent and the wrong intent would produce a structurally different article → ask *one* question: definition, how-to, or comparison?
- Batch mode only: the user said "give me ideas" without a topic → ask *one* question: what topic area and roughly how many.

Never ask about word count, audience, or must-cover sub-topics. Never ask a follow-up "just to confirm." Never chain multiple `AskUserQuestion` calls for a single brief — that's the bad UX this rule exists to prevent.

If the resulting article misses the mark, the colleague will tell you via chat edits. That round-trip is cheaper than front-loading a 4-question survey.

### 2. Duplicate-topic check
Fetch `https://github.com/cruciate-hub/marketing-team/blob/main/website/pages-answers.json` and scan `metaTitle` and heading hierarchy for topic overlap. If a close match exists, surface it and ask whether to update instead. Also scan `pages-glossary.json` — if the topic is a definition that belongs in the glossary, route there.

### 3. Brand-messaging fetch (non-negotiable)
Run `scripts/fetch_brand.py` to pull:
```
terminology.md  tone.md  narrative.md  value-story.md  positioning.md  boilerplates.md
```
Always use `github.com/.../blob/...` URLs — raw and API hosts are blocked by network egress. If any fetch fails, stop and tell the user. Do not proceed on memorized brand content.

The pitch section at the end of every article is **generated from the fetched brand-messaging files**, not from a template inside this skill. `positioning.md` and `value-story.md` define what social.plus says about itself; `boilerplates.md` provides the approved long-form company descriptions. The skill defers to those files.

### 4. Question research
Before writing the FAQ section, surface real follow-up questions. The skill uses Ahrefs MCP tools when available and falls back to WebSearch otherwise:

- **Preferred (Ahrefs MCP tools available):**
  - `serp-overview` for the article's core question — returns the literal PAA block and "Related searches" slot. Most accurate source.
  - `keywords-explorer-search-suggestions` for question-form variants of the target keyword.
  - `keywords-explorer-overview` for the target keyword itself — confirms volume and intent alignment.
- **Fallback (no Ahrefs):**
  - `WebSearch` on the core question; capture any "People Also Ask" phrasings visible in the results.
  - Check the most relevant subreddit (top-of-all-time + top-of-year for the topic).
- Write the FAQ section using these real phrasings, not invented ones. In `outputs/questions.md`, the **Source** column records where each candidate came from (Ahrefs PAA, Ahrefs suggestions, WebSearch, Reddit, LLM fallback).
- Do not embed source URLs in the document itself (no HTML comments — the output is a Word document). List the source URLs in the final message to the user so the team can log them wherever they track FAQ research.

## Article structure — choose by intent

Match structure to query intent. Do not force every article into one template. Each pattern is a starting point; adapt sections if the topic demands it.

| Intent signal | Pattern file |
|---|---|
| "What is X?" / topic is a concept | `references/patterns/definition.md` |
| "How to X?" / "How do you X?" / "Steps to..." | `references/patterns/procedural.md` |
| "X vs Y" / "X or Y" / "alternatives to X" | `references/patterns/comparative.md` |

Every pattern shares these required elements: answer-first block (sentences 1-2 = 40-60 words, TL;DR paragraph = 120-160 words), at least one markdown table, 4-6 FAQ pairs from real phrasings, pitch section (brand-driven), conclusion. No fixed section count beyond those elements — if a sub-topic doesn't belong in this article, don't add it.

## Writing rules (essentials)

Full rules: `references/writing-style.md`. Non-negotiables:

- **Sentence 1** = a direct definition containing the exact target-keyword phrase. 20-30 words.
- **Sentence 2** = the mechanism, scope, or outcome. 20-30 words. Combined with sentence 1: 40-60 words total.
- **TL;DR paragraph** immediately below = 120-160 words, structured as expanded definition → mechanism → outcome → proof point. This is the block AI engines extract verbatim; 120-160 is the research-backed sweet spot for AI-Overview passage selection.
- **~150-word chunks.** Each H2 section is self-contained. A reader landing mid-page still understands it.
- **First mention of a technical entity gets an inline one-clause gloss** using canonical phrasing from `terminology.md`.
- **Citation density depends on intent** (see below) — don't force citations into product how-tos where they'd be faked.
- **Concrete over vague.** Named examples and numeric ranges beat adjectives.
- **Banned constructs:** em dashes, emojis, "revolutionize / unlock / game-changing / leverage", "in today's / now more than ever / in the ever-evolving" openers, passive voice where active works, growth guarantees, wrong `social.plus` casing.

## Citation density by intent

Forcing external citations into product how-tos produces faked or irrelevant links. Apply per-intent rules:

| Intent | External citations | Internal grounding |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | ≥2 recommended — cite authoritative sources for the definition and scale | Named social.plus entities and inline glosses |
| Comparative | ≥3 recommended — you're comparing things, cite the things | Dimension-specific data points, honest positioning |
| Procedural | None required | Internal product consistency, named methods, numeric ranges, concrete timelines |

All intents: every numeric claim needs a source (internal approved list or external link). No anonymous or content-farm citations.

Full guidance: `references/citation-playbook.md`.

## Approved data and customer names

Use only these. Never fabricate.

**Metric ranges (from published social.plus data):**
- Engagement rate: 20-50%
- Retention lift: 10-35%
- Active contributors: 10-30%

**Approved customers:** Noom, Harley-Davidson, Smart Fit, Ulta Beauty, Betgames.

**Approved customer stats:**
- Noom: 45M+ users
- Harley-Davidson: 1M+ community members
- Smart Fit: 60% MoM growth
- Betgames: 200M users

## Output format

The final deliverable is a **Word document** (`.docx`) saved in the outputs directory, filename = `[slug].docx`. A separate automation (outside this skill) converts the Word document to Webflow-ready HTML.

Because the output is Word, **no HTML of any kind appears in the document** — no JSON-LD, no `<script>`, no `<!-- comments -->`, no inline HTML anywhere. Schema, canonical tags, and page meta are handled downstream by the Webflow automation plus the Webflow template itself.

### Two-stage production

1. **Draft a markdown intermediate** at `outputs/[slug].draft.md`. This is what the compliance script reads.
2. **Convert to `.docx`** by invoking the `anthropic-skills:docx` skill with the intermediate as input. The docx skill preserves headings, tables, lists, bold, and hyperlinks. Deliver the resulting `outputs/[slug].docx` as the primary artifact.

Keep the `.draft.md` alongside the `.docx` so maintainers can diff edits across versions.

### Markdown intermediate structure

```
# [Article title]

Meta description: [≤160 chars including spaces]
Slug: [lowercase-with-hyphens, derived from title]
Alt text: Abstract visualization of [main topic from title]
Intent: [definition | procedural | comparative]

[Answer-first block — sentences 1-2, 40-60 words combined]

[TL;DR paragraph — 120-160 words]

## [First body section]

...
```

Rules for the intermediate:
- `# Title` is the only H1.
- The four labeled-paragraph metadata lines sit between the H1 and the answer-first block. They become body paragraphs in the Word doc and the Webflow automation parses and strips them.
- The answer-first block and TL;DR sit under the metadata, above the first H2.
- Markdown tables (pipes and dashes), numbered/bulleted lists, `**bold**`, and inline markdown links `[anchor](URL)` are all supported by the docx skill's conversion.
- External citations as markdown links where the intent calls for them. Internal links (to social.plus URLs) are handled by `internal-linking-optimizer`.

Alt text pattern: `Abstract visualization of [main topic from title]`.

## Internal linking

After drafting and before running compliance, invoke the `internal-linking-optimizer` skill in **draft mode**:
- Pass: full article markdown, the article title (= target keyword), content type `AEO`.
- The optimizer returns 1-3 markdown links. AEO articles use markdown links only, never HTML.
- Allowed sections: the definition chunk, "why it matters", architecture/features, step-by-step.
- Disallowed sections: FAQs, conclusion, metrics table — these stay link-free for clean citation extraction.
- Never force links. Zero is acceptable.

## Compliance — deterministic

Run `python3 scripts/compliance.py outputs/[slug].draft.md` before converting to `.docx`. The script reads the markdown intermediate. Exit 0 = ready to convert; exit 1 = fix first.

Checks:
- Required labeled-paragraph metadata present (title from H1; Meta description, Slug, Alt text, Intent from labeled paragraphs under H1)
- Intent is one of: definition, procedural, comparative
- Meta description ≤ 160 characters including spaces
- Title-keyword phrase appears in sentence 1 of the answer-first block
- Sentence 1 does not start with a filler opener ("In today's…", "Now more than ever…", "In the ever-evolving…", "In a world where…")
- First two sentences in 40-60 word range
- TL;DR paragraph in 120-160 word range
- No em dashes, no emojis, no forbidden terms
- No HTML of any kind — no tags, no comments, no JSON-LD. The output is a Word document.
- Heading hierarchy well-formed (single H1, no skipped levels)
- External citations count meets intent target (definition ≥2, comparative ≥3, procedural any)
- Approved-customer whitelist — no mentions of unapproved customer names
- Word count inside the intent-specific typical range (warning only, does not fail)

Fix every failure before delivering. Warnings are informational — address if it makes the article stronger, skip if not.

## Self-check before delivery

After the compliance script passes, answer each of these yes/no before returning the article:

1. Does sentence 1 literally answer the question the title asks, using the target-keyword phrase?
2. Does the TL;DR paragraph stand alone as an extractable 120-160 word passage?
3. Does every numeric claim have a source (approved-data list or external citation)?
4. Does the pitch section reflect the fetched `positioning.md` / `value-story.md` / `boilerplates.md`, not a template from memory?
5. Are the FAQ questions phrased from real-user research (not invented patterns)?
6. Did the compliance script exit 0?

Any "no" → revise before delivering. Do not ship with unresolved "no".

## Delivery

1. After compliance passes, convert `outputs/[slug].draft.md` to `outputs/[slug].docx` by invoking the `anthropic-skills:docx` skill with the intermediate as input.
2. Tell the user the `.docx` is ready in the artifact panel and the `.draft.md` is kept alongside for diff-able revisions.
3. In the same message, list the FAQ source URLs used in the research step (since they are not embedded in the document).
4. For edit requests, edit the `.draft.md`, re-run compliance, then re-convert to `.docx` and overwrite. Always keep the `.draft.md` in sync with the `.docx`.

## Rationalization table — common shortcuts that fail

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The intro reads better with context first." | LLMs extract the first two sentences. If the answer isn't there, it isn't cited. |
| "Procedural articles need external citations too." | No — they need internal product consistency. Fake citations are worse than none. |
| "I can skip the duplicate check — this topic feels unique." | Check anyway. Rewriting into an existing page beats creating a near-duplicate. |
| "The brand fetch failed but I remember the tone." | Stop. Memorized brand content drifts. Tell the user. |
| "I'll eyeball compliance — the article looks clean." | Run the script. Meta length, keyword-in-sentence-1, and filler openers consistently slip past eyeball review. |
| "I can pad to hit the word count target." | Padding dilutes chunk quality. Under target → the brief is thinner than expected; raise it with the user. Over target → cut padding, not substance. |
| "The pitch template is easier than adapting from brand files." | The pitch is brand-driven, not template-driven. Generic pitches get skipped by LLMs. |
| "I can invent a plausible customer example." | Never. Use the approved list or leave the example out. |
| "I should confirm what the user wants before drafting." | Only if something is genuinely unresolvable. A clear brief ("write an AEO article on X") is a green light to draft. Asking 3-4 intake questions on a clear brief is the single most annoying failure mode this skill has. |

## Batch workflow

When the brief covers multiple articles, run these four phases instead of the single-article flow. Each phase produces a markdown artifact in `outputs/` that the colleague reviews. She approves or refines via chat using the approval syntax below. The skill updates the artifact and moves to the next phase when she says `next`. Full specs for each phase live in `references/workflow-phases.md`.

### Phase A — Ideas
- If the brief already names a topic area and count ("5 articles on community infrastructure"), **skip intake** and proceed to brand fetch + gap scan. Only ask one `AskUserQuestion` when the user said "give me ideas" with no topic area at all — and even then, ask about topic area and count, nothing else.
- Fetch brand once, then scan `pages-answers.json` (and `pages-glossary.json`) for gaps.
- **Fit scoring:** if the Ahrefs MCP tools are available, use `keywords-explorer-overview` to attach real search volume and difficulty to each candidate's target keyword, and use `site-explorer-organic-keywords` on existing /answers/ URLs to catch semantic duplicates the JSON scan missed. If Ahrefs is unavailable, fall back to qualitative fit (high/medium/low) based on topic relevance and gap coverage.
- Write `outputs/ideas.md` — 8-15 candidate articles with: #, title, intent, rationale, target keyword, fit (volume + difficulty if Ahrefs is available, or qualitative otherwise).
- She approves a subset. The skill rewrites `outputs/ideas.md` to show only the approved set.

### Phase B — Questions
- For each approved idea, run the question research (PAA + Reddit).
- Write `outputs/questions.md` — one section per approved idea, 8-10 candidate FAQ questions each.
- She approves per-article. The skill updates the file.

### Phase C — Drafts
- For each approved idea with approved questions, draft `outputs/[slug].draft.md` following the single-article structure (choose pattern by intent).
- Write `outputs/overview.md` — one row per article with title, word count, compliance status.
- She can chat edits on any draft ("article 2 shorter", "add pitfalls to article 3"). The skill edits that draft, re-runs `scripts/compliance.py`, updates `overview.md`.

### Phase D — Delivery
- When all drafts pass compliance, convert each `[slug].draft.md` to `outputs/[slug].docx` via the `anthropic-skills:docx` skill.
- Run `python3 scripts/make_zip.py` to bundle all `.docx` files into `outputs/aeo-batch-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`.
- Send the colleague a final chat summary listing: each `.docx` filename, the zip filename, and the FAQ source URLs per article. The `.docx` and `.zip` files appear in the artifact panel; she clicks each to download.

### Approval syntax

Consistent across phases. Parse these lines at the start of each chat turn; fall back to natural language if the message doesn't match.

```
approve: 1, 3, 5-7
drop: 2, 6
revise: 4 — make it about retention
next
```

For Phase B, scope to an article:
```
article 1: approve 1-4, drop 5
article 2: approve 1, 3, 5; revise 2 — drop the pricing angle
next
```

### When to abort a batch

- Brand fetch fails → stop at Phase A, tell her, do not proceed on memorized brand.
- No gaps found in `pages-answers.json` → surface this at Phase A, ask whether to update existing articles instead.
- Compliance failures in Phase C that can't be auto-fixed after one rewrite → surface to her before moving to Phase D.
- `anthropic-skills:docx` unavailable → tell her; skip Phase D conversion; deliver the `.draft.md` files as fallback.
