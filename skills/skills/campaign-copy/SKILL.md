# social.plus Campaign & Ad Copy

This skill produces high-converting ad copy and campaign landing page content for social.plus. Ad copy operates under extreme space constraints, so every word must earn its place — while still following brand terminology and positioning.

## What to do

1. Fetch the main brain for cross-domain routing, precedence rules, and the compliance check:
```
https://github.com/socialplus-tools/marketing-team/blob/main/brain.md
```

2. Fetch the messaging router:
```
https://github.com/socialplus-tools/marketing-team/blob/main/messaging/brain.md
```

3. Follow the messaging router's **"Short-form content that compares, differentiates, or sells"** routing. This loads:
   - `terminology.md` + `tone.md` (always)
   - `value-story.md` (differentiation framework, core problems — essential for ad copy)

4. Also follow **"Short-form content"** routing for:
   - `boilerplates.md` (elevator pitches — useful as ad copy starting points)
   - `positioning.md` (product pillars for framing)

5. If the campaign includes a landing page, also follow **"Long-form content"** routing for:
   - `narrative.md` (messaging hierarchy for page structure)

6. If the landing page needs visual design, also fetch:
```

```

## Ad copy guidelines

### Headlines
- Lead with the outcome or tension, not the product name.
- "Your users leave apps without community" > "social.plus adds community features"
- Use the value propositions from `value-story.md` — don't invent new claims.

### Descriptions
- One idea per ad. Don't compress the entire product story into 90 characters.
- Match the headline's promise — don't bait-and-switch.
- End with a clear CTA that matches the landing page destination.

### A/B variants
- When asked for variants, differentiate on **angle** (pain point vs. outcome vs. social proof), not just word choice.
- Label each variant with the angle it tests.

### Landing pages
- Follow the narrative structure from `narrative.md` for page flow.
- One primary CTA per section. Never stack two gradient CTAs.
- Hero copy should resolve the headline's promise within 2 sentences.

## Platform-specific formats

### Google Ads — Responsive Search Ads (RSA)

RSAs allow up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions. Google dynamically tests combinations.

| Element | Max length | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Headline | 30 chars | Up to 15 (min 3) |
| Description | 90 chars | Up to 4 (min 2) |
| Display path | 15 chars each | 2 segments |

**Rules:**
- Headlines must make sense in any combination — no headline should depend on another.
- Pin headlines to positions only when specified by the user (e.g., brand name in position 1).
- Include the target keyword in at least 3 headlines.
- At least 1 description should include a CTA.
- Provide display path suggestions (e.g., `/community` `/sdk`).

### LinkedIn Ads

| Element | Max length |
|---|---|
| Introductory text | 600 chars (150 before truncation) |
| Headline | 200 chars (70 recommended) |
| Description | 100 chars |

**Rules:**
- Front-load the hook in the first 150 chars of introductory text (before "see more").
- Professional tone — LinkedIn audience is decision-makers, not end users.
- Headline should state the outcome, not the product.

### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)

| Element | Max length |
|---|---|
| Primary text | 125 chars before truncation (max 2,200) |
| Headline | 40 chars |
| Description | 30 chars |

**Rules:**
- Primary text: lead with a hook or question. The first 125 chars determine whether users expand.
- Headline: outcome-driven. Short enough that it doesn't truncate on mobile.
- Description: supporting detail — often hidden on mobile, so don't put critical info here.

```

```
## Landing Page — [Campaign/Topic]

**Hero headline:** [value]
**Hero subheadline:** [value]
**Hero CTA:** [button text] → [destination URL]

**Section 1:** [heading + body copy]
**Section 2:** [heading + body copy]
...

**Final CTA:** [button text] → [destination URL]

**Meta title:** [under 60 chars]
**Meta description:** [under 155 chars]
```

## What NOT to do

- Never fabricate performance claims ("10x engagement") unless sourced from reference files.
- Never use competitor names in ad headlines — comparison belongs in landing page body.
- Never promise "free" unless the pricing page confirms a free tier exists.
- Never exceed platform character limits. Always show the character count next to each element.
- Never write a headline that only makes sense when paired with a specific other headline (RSA rule).

## Before delivering

Run the compliance check from `brain.md`. Ad copy is high-spend content — a terminology violation wastes budget and confuses prospects.

## Important: URL format

**Always use `github.com/.../blob/...` URLs when fetching files.** Never attempt `raw.githubusercontent.com` — it is blocked by network egress settings.
