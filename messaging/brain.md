# social.plus Brand Messaging — Router

This file is the entry point for all social.plus brand-aligned content tasks. It tells you which files to fetch based on what the user needs.

All files are hosted at:
`https://github.com/socialplus-tools/marketing-team/blob/main/messaging/`

**Warning:** Always use `github.com/.../blob/...` URLs when fetching. Never convert to `raw.githubusercontent.com` or `api.github.com` — both are blocked by network egress restrictions and will fail.

## How to use this file

1. You fetched this file first. Good.
2. Also fetch the main brain if you haven't already: `https://github.com/socialplus-tools/marketing-team/blob/main/brain.md` — it has cross-domain routing, precedence rules, and the compliance check you must run before delivering.
3. Read the user's request.
4. Match it against the routing table below.
5. Fetch the listed files using WebFetch on the GitHub blob URLs above.
6. Apply everything you fetch. Terminology and tone are non-negotiable.

## Routing table

### Any content task (always fetch these)
- `terminology.md` — Approved and forbidden terms. This is law.
- `tone.md` — Tone of voice and writing style rules.

### Short-form content (social posts, email subject lines, ad copy, taglines, product descriptions)
- `boilerplates.md` — Standardized descriptions and elevator pitches as starting points.
- `positioning.md` — Company overview, vision, mission, product pillars. Needed to frame even short copy accurately.

### Short-form content that compares, differentiates, or sells (ad copy, competitive responses, CTAs with value claims)
- `value-story.md` — Differentiation framework, core problems we solve, value creation model.

### Social media posts (LinkedIn, Instagram, X)
- `boilerplates.md` — Standardized descriptions as starting points.
- Also fetch from the design-system domain: `https://github.com/socialplus-tools/marketing-team/blob/main/design-system/social-posts.md` — Platform-specific format specs, character limits, copy structure templates, visual asset guidelines. This file has precedence over `tone.md` for platform-specific tone and formatting.

### Long-form content (blog posts, landing pages, thought leadership, whitepapers, case studies, press releases)
- `narrative.md` — Messaging hierarchy and 5-step narrative structure.
- `value-story.md` — Core problems we solve, value creation model, differentiation framework.
- `positioning.md` — Company overview, vision, mission, ecosystem position, product pillars.

### Positioning or identity questions (what is social.plus, who do we serve, what are our pillars)
- `positioning.md` — Company overview, vision, mission, ecosystem position, product pillars.

### UI copy (button labels, form text, error messages, empty states, tooltips)
- `ui-micro-copy.md` — Capitalisation, punctuation, microcopy patterns, and anti-patterns. This file has precedence over `tone.md` for UI copy voice and style.

### Content review or audit (checking existing copy against brand guidelines)
- Fetch ALL files. Compare the content under review against every guideline.

## Rules

- **Terminology is law.** Always use approved terms. Never use forbidden terms. No exceptions.
- **Tone comes from the documents, not from your defaults.** Override your natural writing style with what the tone file specifies.
- **Never invent.** Do not fabricate statistics, customer names, quotes, features, or performance claims. If it's not in the fetched documents, don't state it.
- **Messaging hierarchy matters.** For content longer than a paragraph: establish the market shift → define infrastructure → engagement → intelligence → revenue → long-term advantage.
- **Boilerplates are starting points.** Adapt to context but preserve meaning and claims.
- **If a fetch fails**, tell the user the GitHub content is unavailable and you cannot guarantee brand alignment. Do not proceed with stale or memorized content.
- **Run the compliance check** from `brain.md` (the main brain) before delivering your output.
